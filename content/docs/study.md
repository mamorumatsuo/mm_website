title: "Study"
weight: 2
summary: We are delving into nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, mediated by angular momentum, in diverse systems like quark-gluon plasmas, ultra-cold atoms, micro/nano-mechanical systems, and spin-valleytronic systems. Our research encompasses timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds

We are working on nonequilibrium quantum dynamics mediated by angular momenta, such as  

- gyromagnetic effect,
- spin-valley transort.
